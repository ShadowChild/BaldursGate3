# CandorModuleTemplate
A template repository for creating a module for Candor.

Before trying to run this, you should follow the quickstart on the Candor github wiki.  
You should change a few of the Strings in the build.gradle and place the Classes in to your package.  
This is designed as a guide for how modules should be laid out.

You should also add '-javaagent:libs/jar-loader.jar' as this is required for your module to be loaded.
